It's a microbenchmarking tool to check your phone's performance and get the benchmark score. Which can be used to compare phones
or to predict the phone's performance. It's a "micro"Benchmarking tool because it will not run any complex benchmarking tests. It 
will just run some simple Java programs in iterations so thet we can get a quick score and we should not have to wait 5-10 minutes.
It will calculate the score according to the time taken by your phone to complete the tests. Also you can checkout previous 
tests and check your phones performance in different situations.
